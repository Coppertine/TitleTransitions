# TitleTransitions

This texture pack provides some simple use transitions for Minecraft.

To view the transitions run the following command, replacing `XX` in the color code with the ID of the transition you want.
```
/title @s title {"text":"a","color":"#XX2301","font":"pvphub:font"}
```

For example to see a left to right transition:
```
/title @s title {"text":"a","color":"#012301","font":"pvphub:font"}
```
